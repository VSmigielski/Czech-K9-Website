        <h1 class="text-center branding mb-3">Why Us?</h1>
        <p class="text-center text-white">
            Why us? Because we are different, we care, we are dog lovers, we feed our dogs the best diet possible. 
            We feed raw meat with fresh vegetables, berries and human grade supplements for the best health results. 
            If any breeder feeds kibbles, run away, your dog will have health problems described below. Would you 
            serve a plate of garbage to your best friend? I don’t think so, and your dog is your best friend, actually 
            more than best friend, because he is able to love you unconditionally, but your human friend is not able 
            to. For those who don’t believe all commercial dog food is nothing else than garbage made of human waste, 
            road kills and sick animals, using sawdust, rocks, sand and mud from the river as a filler, so it weighs 
            more, put in YouTube search “dog food rendering” and you will find more than dozen videos about dog food. 
            Dog food manufactures lie to us.  They can do whatever they want to do because nobody controls them. 
            They are ruled by the money not to help your pet. They should be all put behind the bars for what they do 
            to your dogs, how many recalls, how many dogs died and how they brainwash their customers with flashy 
            commercials full of bull and lies. Watch it all.
        </p>
        <p class="text-center text-white">
            Before dog food was invented, dogs didn’t have any cancer, epilepsy, seizures, bloated stomachs, 
            depression, mental problems, brain damage, loss of orientation, allergies, skin problems and any 
            other health problems. Wild wolfs and coyotes still don’t have any of those problems, because they 
            don’t eat kibbles. Where is the problem? The answer is: A commercial dog food.
        </p>
        <p class="text-center text-white">
            Our dogs are as healthy as they can be. They don’t die on cancer at age of 4 years, their hair is shiny, 
            they are always happy, their brain is healthy and sharp, they react on commands immediately, their body 
            is very muscular even they don’t have that much exercise what would create the muscularity. And poop is 
            very small and solid, smells like mushrooms in the forest not like an open septic.

            <p class="text-center">
                We have one of the best German Shepherds, and the best GSDs puppies available.
                We select only the best and smartest GSDs to be imported from Czech Republic,
                Slovakia and East Germany to our customers and for our breeding program.
            </p>
            <p class="text-center">
                We love dogs, we rescue dogs, retrain and rehabilitate dogs what other trainers screwed up.
                Our dogs live part of the day outside and part of the day inside, so they have always something to 
                look forward to. To lock dogs in the kennel full time, or chain a dog to the doghouse is not a good 
                idea. He will be depressed missing human or other dogs’ company, or will get over-aggressive from 
                frustration of his miserable life you will give him.
            </p>
            <p class="text-center">
                The other day someone was calling us, asking me for a puppy, told me he has 10 acres, plenty of room 
                for dog to roaming. Yeah, but dog don’t care about any roaming, he wants to be with you, he wants 
                to be part of the family. That’s why many police officers and security guards taking their service 
                dogs home. Well, they also have an extra protection at home, hahaha.

                We are located in sunny Arizona where sunshine is 360 days a year. Plenty of vitamin D good for dogs and for humans.
