                    <div class="fakeimg picture mt-2" style="height:300px;"></div>
                    <p class="text-center mt-3">
                        Dogs are smart animals. They can learn many commands and dozens of tricks. They can track down humans 
                        and animals on very long distances. Hunting dogs can catch you dinner, herding dogs can keep your sheep 
                        together and guard dogs can protect you while keeping your property safe from intruders. Dogs can even 
                        learn to skateboard. They have the instincts to hide under the bushes when its raining or when there is 
                        too much sunshine. They can swim as well as learn to dive to fetch objects from underwater. They are 
                        fantastic, one of a kind animals. They love humans more than they love themselves because they show 
                        unconditional love; however, there are a few things they don’t understand. One unfortunate thing they 
                        don’t understand is that they can get killed by running in front of a car. Another thing they don’t 
                        understand is that if they jump out from a truck-bed while the truck is running, they can get killed. 
                        That’s why you see many dead dogs on the side of the road.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-center">
                        As humans, we understand the dangers that dogs don't. We should protect our dogs from being killed by cars.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-center">
                        1. When you see a stray dog running on the side of the road or crossing the road, please slow down or 
                        stop. You can honk your horn to scare them away or even open your window and yell at them in hopes that 
                        they will run away. Since we understand that dogs are not aware of being killed by the cars, we should 
                        try to prevent an unfavorable outcome.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-center mb-2">
                        2. If you want to take your dog for a ride on the back of your truck, always tie him up in the middle of 
                        the truck. This ensures that your dog can’t jump out of the running truck and get killed. There is a penalty 
                        in California if you don’t adhere to this practice and I support this law. Dogs are wonderful creatures; 
                        unfortunately, many people are ignorant.

                        To lock dogs in the kennel full time, or chain a dog to the doghouse is not a good idea. He will be 
                        depressed missing human or other dogs’ company, or will get over-aggressive from frustration of his 
                        miserable life you will give him.

                        The other day someone was calling us, asking me for a puppy, told me he has 10 acres, plenty of room 
                        for dog to roaming. Yeah, but dog don’t care about any roaming, he wants to be with you, he wants to 
                        be part of the family. That’s why many police officers and security guards taking their service dogs 
                        home. Well, they also have an extra protection at home, hahaha.

                    <h2>Raw Food Diet vs Processed Food Diet</h2>

                        If your selected breeder feeds their dogs kibble, you should run away. Kibble is known to cause various 
                        health problems. Before dog food was invented, dogs didn’t have cancer, epilepsy, seizures, bloated stomachs, 
                        depression, mental problems, brain damage, loss of orientation, allergies, skin problems and any other health 
                        problems. Wild wolves and coyotes still don’t have any of the problems listed above. The one differentiation 
                        between wild dgos and family dogs is that wild dogs don’t eat kibble. Where does the problem lie? The answer 
                        is: commercial dog food.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I think of kibble, I consider it to be on the same level as garbage. Would you serve a plate of garbage 
                        to your best friend? I wouldn't. Since your dog is your best friend, actually even better than a best friend 
                        because dogs love unconditionally, I think that our dogs should be treated with the same amount of thought as 
                        a best friend.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For those who don’t believe that all commercial dog food is nothing more than garbage which is made of human 
                        waste, road kill and sick animals, sawdust, rocks, sand and mud from the river as a filler (so it weighs more), 
                        search YouTube using these keywords “dog food rendering”. You will find more than a dozen videos about dog food 
                        and the processes that it goes through. Dog food manufacturers lie to us. They can do whatever they want because 
                        nobody controls them. They are ruled by money rather than helping your pet. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They should be all put behind the bars for what they do to our dogs. You should ask yourself these questions: 
                        How many recalls occurred? How many dogs have died? They brainwash their customers into buying their "special" 
                        food with flashy commercials full of bull and lies. Watch all the videos so that you're informed.
