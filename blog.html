                    <div class="fakeimg picture mt-2" style="height:300px;"></div>

                        Dogs are smart animals. They can learn many commands and dozens of tricks. They can track down humans 
                        and animals on very long distances. Hunting dogs can catch you dinner, herding dogs can keep your sheep 
                        together and guard dogs can protect you while keeping your property safe from intruders. Dogs can even 
                        learn to skateboard. They have the instincts to hide under the bushes when its raining or when there is 
                        too much sunshine. They can swim as well as learn to dive to fetch objects from underwater. They are 
                        fantastic, one of a kind animals. They love humans more than they love themselves because they show 
                        unconditional love; however, there are a few things they don’t understand. One unfortunate thing they 
                        don’t understand is that they can get killed by running in front of a car. Another thing they don’t 
                        understand is that if they jump out from a truck-bed while the truck is running, they can get killed. 
                        That’s why you see many dead dogs on the side of the road.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-center">
                        As humans, we understand the dangers that dogs don't. We should protect our dogs from being killed by cars.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-center">
                        1. When you see a stray dog running on the side of the road or crossing the road, please slow down or 
                        stop. You can honk your horn to scare them away or even open your window and yell at them in hopes that 
                        they will run away. Since we understand that dogs are not aware of being killed by the cars, we should 
                        try to prevent an unfavorable outcome.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-center mb-2">
                        2. If you want to take your dog for a ride on the back of your truck, always tie him up in the middle of 
                        the truck. This ensures that your dog can’t jump out of the running truck and get killed. There is a penalty 
                        in California if you don’t adhere to this practice and I support this law. Dogs are wonderful creatures; 
                        unfortunately, many people are ignorant.

                        To lock dogs in the kennel full time, or chain a dog to the doghouse is not a good idea. He will be 
                        depressed missing human or other dogs’ company, or will get over-aggressive from frustration of his 
                        miserable life you will give him.

                        The other day someone was calling us, asking me for a puppy, told me he has 10 acres, plenty of room 
                        for dog to roaming. Yeah, but dog don’t care about any roaming, he wants to be with you, he wants to 
                        be part of the family. That’s why many police officers and security guards taking their service dogs 
                        home. Well, they also have an extra protection at home, hahaha.

                        If any breeder feeds kibbles, run away, your dog will have health problems described below. Would you 
                        serve a plate of garbage to your best friend? I don’t think so, and your dog is your best friend, 
                        actually more than best friend, because he is able to love you unconditionally, but your human friend 
                        is not able to. For those who don’t believe all commercial dog food is nothing else than garbage made 
                        of human waste, road kills and sick animals, using sawdust, rocks, sand and mud from the river as a 
                        filler, so it weighs more, put in YouTube search “dog food rendering” and you will find more than dozen 
                        videos about dog food. Dog food manufactures lie to us. They can do whatever they want to do because 
                        nobody controls them. They are ruled by the money not to help your pet. They should be all put behind 
                        the bars for what they do to your dogs, how many recalls, how many dogs died and how they brainwash 
                        their customers with flashy commercials full of bull and lies. Watch it all.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before dog food was invented, dogs didn’t have any cancer, epilepsy, seizures, bloated stomachs, 
                        depression, mental problems, brain damage, loss of orientation, allergies, skin problems and any 
                        other health problems. Wild wolfs and coyotes still don’t have any of those problems, because they 
                        don’t eat kibbles. Where is the problem? The answer is: A commercial dog food.

                        titled several dogs with the Schutzhund title. I have mastered dog psychology in early years. I 
                        understand the work that goes into training a dog. I strongly believe that any dog is trainable
