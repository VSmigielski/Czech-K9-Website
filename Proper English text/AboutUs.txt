We have one of the best German Shepherd lineages available to breed from and the best German Shepherd puppies available for purchase. We select only the best and smartest German Shepherd Dogs, GSDs, to be imported from the Czech Republic, Slovakia and East Germany for our customers and for our breeding program.

We absolutely love dogs! We rescue dogs, retrain dogs, and even rehabilitate dogs when their prior training has not been on par. Our dogs enjoy part of the day outside and part of the day inside so they always have something to look forward to.

We are located in sunny Arizona where sunshine is 360 days a year. With so much sun per year, there is plenty of vitamin D which is good for dogs and humans alike.
