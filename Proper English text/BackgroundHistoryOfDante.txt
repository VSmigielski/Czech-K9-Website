Hi, my name is Dee Dee. I am a dog trainer who has over 30 years of experience training dogs. I have titled several dogs with the Schutzhund title. I have mastered dog psychology in early years. I understand the work that goes into training a dog. I strongly believe that any dog is trainable if you know how. And I know how.

I would like to bring your attention to the fact that I am the first trainer who has been able to train dogs ONLINE WORLDWIDE. I have customers from Australia, Canada, Germany, Finland, Sweden, and the UK.
