Because we are different. We care because we love dogs. With this in mind, we feed our dogs the best diet possible. This diet consists of raw meat, vegetables, berries, and human grade supplements for the best health results. Due to a nearly raw diet, their poop is very small and solid. Our dogs are as healthy as they can be. Their coats are shiny, their brain is healthy and sharp, and their body is very muscular, even though they aren't exercising intensely. Our dogs and puppies are always happy and maintain quick, immediate reactions to commands.
