We are selecting puppies from famous Czech working bloodlines: Czech Police GSDs, Slovak Police GSDs and old Border Patrol GSDs, the best of the best.

We will be breeding 2 German Shepherd females here in our kennel in Arizona, USA and puppies will be available soon!!!

We have sons and daughters of the former Champion of the World, IPO3 Qvido Vepeden, in our kennel.

Qvido’s puppies are something out of your wildest imagination. They are the perfect version of a German Shepherd. They have the speed and drive of the Malinois and the beauty, aggression and strong bite of the Czech German Shepherds which is one of the best protection and guard dogs in the world.

There are many breeders claiming that they have Qvido Vepeden puppies. But, do they really? We know the handler of Qvido Vladimír Ouška and his family in person. We are friends. We are all Czechs and Slovaks and we know our dogs. We have deep understanding of the German Shepherd breed. We have Germans coming to breed with our dogs and we go to Germany to breed with their dogs to preserve the best lineage of German Shepherds.
