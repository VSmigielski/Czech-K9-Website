We board dogs of any size, breed, and temperament. We also provide house sitting, in case your pet doesnâ€™t do well in a foreign environment.

If your dog is friendly and an indoor pet, he will be kept inside our home. If your dog likes to be outside, we have a nice outdoor kennel ready for him. Aggressive and guard dogs will stay in our outdoor kennel. 

We clean up the kennels frequently. We will take your dog for a walk or play with him utilizing his favorite toys. We have installed mist fans for summer time and heat lamps for the winter time.
