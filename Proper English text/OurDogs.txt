Byna IPO3 is from the Slovakia Police blood line. She is a very tough, working female with strong bones and unbelievable drive.

I guess I don’t have to say much more. She is a copy of Qvido. Her body structure is very much like Qvido’s and she is very obedient with a great guarding instinct. Corda was imported directly from the Czech Republic. She has inconceivable drive and fantastic speed.

Castor is Qvido Vepeden’s son. He is a strong and confident male. He was imported from the Czech Republic. Castor is a large male with high energy seen only at Malinois. However, he is larger, stronger, and not afraid of anything. His bite is firm and strong.

This GSD girl was imported directly from East Germany, she is a former DDR. She is from a secret German DDR working blood line. Germans believe that this DDR blood line is a German’s treasure and don’t want to sell these GSDs out of Germany. She has a stable, balanced temperament and is extremely obedient which is very typical for DDR dogs. She has a great guarding instinct and her beauty is exceptional!
